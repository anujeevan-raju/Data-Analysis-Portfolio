# ANUJEEVAN R - Data Analyst Portfolio.

## About.

Hi! My name is Anujeevan R. And I am a SQL developer for 1.5 years, having a keen interest to shift in the field of data analytics. My work experience along with some self study has given me a fair understanding of how databases are maintained and how data is processed and I wish to apply those skills as a junior level data analyst.

As a SQL Developer, I have developed and improved my professional skills by dealing with intricate queries and database designs. I know computer language,s such as SQL, python, and also know how to use other software like Excel, Power BI. My ability to solve problems has improved because I can create effective queries and build data visualizations.

As an individual with a solid grounding in technical skills, I wish to broaden my focus from basic IT functions to more deeper, data driven analysis. I love to analyze data from different angles to discover critical information and patterns that would assist in making important business decisions.

Outside of work, I am a dedicated cricket player and love to travel to new places. I also find solace in listening to music. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I am driven by the thrill of transforming raw data into actionable insights and am always looking to enhance my expertise in data analytics.
