# ANUJEEVAN R - Data Analyst Portfolio.

## About.

Hello, I'm Anujeevan R, with a 1.5 years of experience as a SQL Developer, I am enthusiastic about moving into the data analytics field. My professional background and self-directed learning have equipped me with a solid understanding of database management and data manipulation, which I am eager to utilize in an entry-level data analyst position.

In my role as a SQL Developer, I have refined my technical abilities by working with complex queries and database structures. I am skilled in key data analysis tools such as SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI. Crafting efficient queries and developing data visualizations has enhanced my analytical skills and problem-solving capabilities.

I am keen to utilize my existing technical knowledge while expanding my role in data analysis. I enjoy exploring data from multiple perspectives to uncover significant insights and patterns that can inform business decisions.

Outside of work, I am a dedicated cricket player and love to travel to new places. I also find solace in listening to music. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I am driven by the thrill of transforming raw data into actionable insights and am always looking to enhance my expertise in data analytics.
